"I am the bone of my sword. Steel is my body and fire is my blood. I have created over a 
thousand blades. Unknown to Death, Nor known to Life. Have withstood pain to create many 
weapons. Yet, those hands will never hold anything. So as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works."

-Archer



"I am the bone of my sword. Steel is my body and fire is my blood. I have created over a
thousand blades. Unaware of loss, Nor aware of gain. Withstood pain to create weapons,
waiting for oneâ€™s arrival. I have no regrets. This is the only path. My whole life was
Unlimited Blade Works."
